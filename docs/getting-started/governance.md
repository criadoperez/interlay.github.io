# Decentralized Governance

Interlay and Kintsugi each implement a token-based decentralized governance mechanism.
Governance token holders have the ultimate decision power over:

- **Runtime upgrades**: Fixes, substrate/library updates, improvements, new features, â€¦
- **Parameter upgrades**:
  - Adding and removing AMM pools
  - Adding and removing money markets
  - Whitelist collateral currencies and set thresholds
  - Configure BTC bridge parameters
  - Adding and removing XCM connections
  - Adding and removing oracles

- **Treasury management**: decision on how to spend the assets locked in the network treasury.

## Governance Implementations
