# Interlay Architecture

Interlay is a modular network optimized to host decentralized Bitcoin
finance protocols. The network consists of four layers as shown below.

-   **Consensus, Computation, and Governance**: The base layer provides
    security through consensus, functionality through computation, and
    community-control through governance.

-   **Infrastructure**: The infrastructure layer enables bridging
    between Bitcoin through Interlay's decentralized bridge as well as
    bridges to other DeFi networks.

-   **DeFi**: The DeFi layer facilitates basic financial primitives
    including lending, borrowing, and exchanging assets.

-   **Application**: The application layer provides easy access for end
    users via the UI as well as developer access via SDKs and APIs.
