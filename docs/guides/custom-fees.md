# Custom Fees Guide

Our dapp no longer limits the user on using solely the parachain governance token (INTR/KINT) to pay transaction fees. There is now available a set of assets to cover for transaction fees and possibly many more in the near future.

You can now find a select option on every transaction form across the dapp.

When you click the select, a modal with the available options for pays fees is shown.

When you select the desired token to cover for fees, an estimation is ran only when you fulfil the form.

After the form is fulfilled, a fee estimaste will run. For you to execute the transaction, the necessary funds to cover tge transaction fee needs to be available. If not, make sure you make more funds available or choose another token from the available set.
