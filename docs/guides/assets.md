?> If you are a developer and looking for the list of supported assets and their IDs, please go [check out the API docs](https://docs.interlay.io/#/developers/api).


## DOT

**What is it?** 

DOT is the native asset of the Polkadot relay chain.

**Use cases** 

Used in many applications in the ecosystem, such as on-chain governance or DeFi. On Interlay it can be used for lending and borrowing, for swaps, or as vault collateral to secure the iBTC bridge.

**How to get DOT**

* **From centralised exchanges**: Withdraw DOT to Polkadot, then use the [cross-chain transfer tab](https://app.interlay.io/transfer) on the app to bridge it to Interlay. [List of supported exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/markets/).
* **From other parachains**: If you already have DOT on a parachain, it first needs to be bridged to the Polkadot relay chain using the cross-chain transfer/xcm-bridging feature of the respective parachain. Once the DOT has been transferred to the relay chain, use the [cross-chain transfer tab](https://app.interlay.io/transfer) on the app to bridge it to Interlay. 
* **From other chains (Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos,..)**: If you are coming from other networks, please see our cross-chain onramp guide below.
* **From USD/Bank/Credit card**: You can use [Banxa](https://talisman.banxa.com/?coinType=DOT&fiatType=EUR) to buy DOT. You will receive it on the Polkadot relay chain and can then use the [cross-chain transfer tab](https://app.interlay.io/transfer) to bridge it to Interlay.
